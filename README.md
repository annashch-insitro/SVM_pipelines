# SVM_pipelines

Example use case on Kundaje lab cluster for SVM input generation: 

```
/mnt/lab_data2/annashch/alzheimers_parkinsons/svm_pipeline/make_inputs
```

Execute scripts in `make_inputs` to generate input files for SVM model training.  
 
Execute scripts in `train_predict` to train SVM models and get model predictions.  

Execute scripts in `score` to get auPRC & other metrics of model performance.  

Execute scripts in `interpret` to run gkmexplain interpretation.  

Execute scripts in `plot_interpretations` to plot gkmexplain interpretations.
