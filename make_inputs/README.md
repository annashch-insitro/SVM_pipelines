Execute the **run.sh** file to generate inputsu for SVM model training. 

That file is a wrapper for the following steps: 

task=$1 # Name of the task being performed, generated by the user.
idr=$2 # NarrowPeak file with IDR peak calls. 

echo "starting $task $idr" 
./get_svm_peak_splits.sh $task $idr
echo "got svm peak splits" 

./get_gc_positives.sh $task
echo "got gc content of the positive sequences" 

./get_all_negatives.sh $task $idr
echo "got candidate negative set" 

./get_chrom_gc_region_dict.sh $task
echo "created python pickle for candidate negatives" 

./form_svm_input_fastas.sh $task
echo "finished creating SVM inputs"
